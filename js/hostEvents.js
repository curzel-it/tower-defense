// Used by toast.js, pickups.js, etc. to push discrete one-shots
// (pickup / death / dialogue / cutscene / toast) onto the wire alongside
// the 20 Hz delta stream.
//
// In offline / guest mode this no-ops, so call sites don't have to gate
// themselves — `showToast("hello")` works the same in single-player.

// kinds (forward-compat), but bouncing them here too keeps a typo at a
// fresh call site (`"toats"`) from hitting the wire and costing
// every guest a parse + dispatch cycle. Toast events also pin
// `toastType` to the showToast modes so a future caller can't smuggle
// a CSS class string through that field.
