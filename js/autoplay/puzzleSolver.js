// Zone-local route/puzzle search: can the player get from a start tile to
// any goal tile, and what does it take — walking and pushing blocks onto
// pressure plates.
//
// Region-based Sokoban search (the only tractable shape for SneakBit's
// 8k–19k-tile dungeons). Between pushes the player walks freely, so the
// macro-state is (pushable positions, player's connected region) — the
// player's exact tile collapses to "which connected region it's in". That
// turns ~8000 player positions per pushable layout into a single flood
// fill, and the search frontier into layout × region states.
//
// Gates are controlled SOLELY by pressure plates (the game's design): a
// Gate is open while its color plate is held down, an InverseGate while
// it's up. Keys (species 2000–2005) are pure collectibles for the finale
// — they never open gates — so the solver has no key logic at all.
//
// A plate is held down by a pushable resting on it OR by the player
// standing on it (puzzles.js updatePlates). The player's weight is
// transient, so it's modelled per-EDGE rather than as persistent state:
// every collision check the engine runs (step commit, push validation)
// happens while the player still stands on the source tile, so that
// tile's plate color reads as down for exactly that move. This lets the
// player walk ONE tile from a plate into an adjacent same-color Gate, and
// push a box through a gate held open by their own weight. Some dungeons
// (e.g. 1005: three plate colors, two boxes) are unsolvable without it.
//
// Boxes barely block the player (player.js share-tile escape hatch): a
// pinned box can be climbed and walked through, a box on a closed gate
// tile bridges it, and a climbed box can be pushed off in any direction
// it can slide. See flood()/successors() for the exact edge rules.
//
// Perf (the plan's Defect B): a solve floods the region once per explored
// state, so the flood is the hot loop. Tiles are int-packed (y*cols+x)
// the moment prepare() ingests the model — the search never touches an
// "x,y" string — and the flood marks visits in a generation-stamped
// Int32Array scratch shared across the solve (no per-flood Set, no
// clearing). Nothing in the inner loop scans zone.entities either: the
// static blocked mask, gate-by-tile and plate-by-color maps are built
// once per solve.

//
// The joint search (above) drowns in the free-floor box-shuffle space once a
// dungeon has 4+ boxes (zones 1013, 1021): it explores hundreds of thousands
// of macro-states without converging. But these puzzles have structure — to
// reach the goal you open the colored gates between you and it, and a gate
// opens when SOME box sits on its color's plate. So instead of one giant joint
// search, solve it as a sequence of single-box sub-solves: look at the gate
// currently blocking the goal (the flood already names it — region.gateStar),
// fully solve "get a box onto that color's plate", commit the pushes, and
// repeat. Each sub-solve moves exactly ONE box (others frozen, still holding
// their plates), so its search is tiny. Greedily fixing the goal-nearest
// blocking gate first naturally discovers the dependency order
// (yellow→blue→red→green in 1013). If any step can't be made — no gateStar, a
// sub-solve fails, or no progress — we bail to the joint search, so a dungeon
// this can't crack behaves exactly as it does today (no regression).

// Drive the decomposition. Returns { moves, state } where `moves` is the full
// push list from world.pushableStart (so done()/finalLayout replay correctly)
// and `state` is the final layout that reaches the goal — or null to fall back.
//
// At each step every plate is a candidate sub-goal: fill it if empty, clear it
// if a box already weighs it. We try them (goal-relevant colors first) and
// commit the first whose single-box sub-solve makes real progress — the goal
// is reached/closer, OR the reachable region simply GREW. That last signal is
// the key: the prerequisite move in 1013 is filling the yellow plate, which
// doesn't shorten the goal distance but opens the yellow gate you walk through
// to reach the blue box — pure region growth. Greedily taking whatever grows
// the region discovers the yellow→blue→red→green order on its own. If nothing
// helps we bail to the joint search, so un-decomposable zones never regress.
