// Creative-mode predicate. Mirrors Rust's `is_creative_mode()` — the
// single source of truth other features consult to gate behavior. The
// HTML port reads `?creative=true` from the URL at boot so the toggle
// is stable for the whole session (no in-game switch); same shape as
// the Rust desktop build that reads the flag once from `argv`.
//
// Default is `false`. See creative-mode-requirements.md for the list
// of behaviors each gate is supposed to change once we wire them up;
// today this module only powers the save export/import gating.
