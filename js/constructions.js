// Construction type metadata. Mirrors game_core/src/maps/constructions.rs.
//
// Slope variants (29..60, four biomes × eight orientations) ship as
// individual ids so the renderer can pick the right corner/edge sprite,
// but we treat them as rectangular obstacles. Rust does the same
// is_obstacle() = true (fall-through to `_ => true`) but additionally
// computes a shaped hittable_frame with per-orientation padding
// (slope_hittable_frame_padding). That extra trim lets the player walk
// into the "downhill" half of a slope tile in Rust; ours rejects the
// whole tile. Cosmetic difference at edges, no functional gap.
