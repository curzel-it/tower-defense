// Per-player HP, brief invulnerability against bullet bursts, regen with a
// short delay after taking damage.
//
// Two damage paths:
//   * applyPlayerDamage(amount, playerIndex)  — instant hits (bullets).
//     Triggers a brief invulnerability window so multiple bullets in one
//     frame don't all stack.
//   * applyPlayerContinuousDamage(amount, playerIndex) — sustained ticks
//     from a melee monster standing on / next to the player. Ignores
//     invuln so the player actually feels the pressure.
// Both paths reset the regen delay, so the player only heals once they've
// been clear of damage for a moment.
//
// Equipment damage reduction (Rust hits_handling_use_case.rs:88) is
// applied multiplicatively before either path consumes HP — every
// currently-equipped weapon contributes `1 - received_damage_reduction`
// to the multiplier (shield 1171 cuts incoming damage by half).
//
// State is stored in a small per-player record array. The single-player
// API continues to operate on index 0 by default so existing call sites
// keep working until they thread a playerIndex.
