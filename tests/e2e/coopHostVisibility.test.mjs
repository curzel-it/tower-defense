// E2E: a guest's mirrored world must contain exactly the entities the
// HOST can see — never an object the host has already collected or
// otherwise hidden. Regression for the cross-client divergence where
// "collected/hidden" state lives in per-client localStorage
// (item_collected.<id> / display_conditions, applied by shouldBeVisible)
// while the host's snapshot broadcaster shipped the raw zone.entities. A
// host that picked up a kunai in an earlier single-player session then
// started hosting would broadcast that kunai; the guest, lacking the
// host's item_collected flag, rendered it (and could "pick up" a ghost).
//
// Zone 1001 is ideal: near spawn (68,23) it has a kunai bundle
// (id 11169819 @ 69,28) and a plain kunai (id 10754446 @ 73,31). We seed
// the host's storage so it considers the bundle collected, leave the
// kunai untouched as a positive control, and assert the guest mirror has
// the kunai but NOT the bundle.
